## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook designed to teach the fundamentals of Python programming. The notebook offers a step-by-step progression from the very basics of variables and data types to more advanced concepts, such as object-oriented programming and working with widely-used libraries like NumPy and Matplotlib.

### Main Topics Covered

1. **Introduction to Python**  
   - Why Python is popular  
   - Quick overview of its capabilities

2. **Variables and Data Types**  
   - Integers, floats, strings, booleans  
   - Casting and type conversion

3. **Basic Operators**  
   - Arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`)  
   - Comparison (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`)  
   - Logical (`and`, `or`, `not`)

4. **Conditionals**  
   - `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements  
   - Implementing decision-making in code

5. **Loops**  
   - `for` loops (including `range()`)  
   - `while` loops and loop control

6. **Functions**  
   - Defining functions with `def`  
   - Returning values and using parameters

7. **Classes (Object-Oriented Programming)**  
   - Defining classes and using the `__init__` method  
   - Methods and attributes  
   - Creating and working with instances (objects)

8. **Working with Modules and Packages**  
   - Importing modules (e.g., `math`, `datetime`)  
   - Using external libraries

9. **NumPy Basics**  
   - Creating and manipulating arrays  
   - Numerical operations (e.g., sum, mean, max)  
   - Understanding array shapes and broadcasting

10. **Matplotlib Basics**  
    - Plotting data with `plt.plot()`  
    - Customizing plots (title, labels, legend)  
    - Displaying interactive plots in a Jupyter environment
